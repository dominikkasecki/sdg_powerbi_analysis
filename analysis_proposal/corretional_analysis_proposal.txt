Correlational Analysis Proposal

This analysis investigates the relationship between Haiti’s economic stability and its access to renewable energy. The hypothesis is that limited financial resources significantly hinder the adoption of green energy technologies. Haiti’s energy profile shows that approximately 80% of its consumption relies on fossil fuels, which negatively impacts sustainability. I propose analyzing the correlation between Haiti’s GDP per capita and national electricity access rates over time. A linear regression model will be used to quantify this relationship. A strong positive correlation would support the hypothesis and offer insight into how economic growth could facilitate a transition to cleaner energy sources. This evidence can enhance the credibility of the research and support data-driven policy recommendations.
