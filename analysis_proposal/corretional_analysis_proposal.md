## üîç Correlational Analysis Proposal

This analysis explores the link between **Haiti‚Äôs economic stability** and its **access to renewable energy**, aiming to determine whether financial limitations significantly hinder green energy adoption.

Currently, approximately **80% of Haiti‚Äôs energy consumption depends on fossil fuels**, which poses sustainability and environmental challenges. To quantify this relationship, I propose examining the **correlation between GDP per capita and electricity access rates** in Haiti over time.

By applying a **linear regression model**, the strength and direction of this correlation can be assessed. A strong positive correlation would reinforce the hypothesis that **economic growth enables greater renewable energy access**, guiding more effective **data-driven policy and investment decisions**.

This analysis supports a key aspect of my SDG-focused research and aligns with broader efforts in sustainable development and energy equity.
